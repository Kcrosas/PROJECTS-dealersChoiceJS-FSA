        <div class='product-list'><h2>Welcome to the Kawasaki Motors Club</h2> <p>Here, you'll find a number of well known (some very much iconic) motorcycles from Kawasaki. At this moment, our club sells all products except the H2R which is reserved for only our professional motorists.</p><p>Personally, I have owned a 250R and the 650R. They are both beginner friendly and are incredibly forgiving. Accidentally dropping your clutch on either WONT cause you to do a wheelie and although it's quite limited on the top end, its acceleration is still very good for a motorcycle.</p></div>
