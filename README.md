# Dealer's Choice

## Homework due 11/03/21

### Kenneth Rosas - Junior Phase - Cohort 2110

This is my version of Dealer's Choice. It was built with my past hobby of motorcycle riding in mind.

Feel free to clone this repo for evaluation purposes.

It consist of three pages that utilizes Node.js and Express.

## Plan

1. Create a main js file that pulls in three different HTML modules
2. Determine the appropriate method of pulling images into the pages
3. First page will list all motorcycles for sale
4. Second page will pull up the detail of whichever motorcycle a user clicks on
5. Third page will either be an 'About' or a 'Contact'
6. If third page is a contact page, I will for now have the user's input relayed as an alert until I determine a method of pushing it out to their default email application

## Changes to Plan

1. HTML modules reduced to two

## Image source

1. Banner image from unknown wallpaper site
2. Motorcycle images are all from ebay
